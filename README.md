# First React App

This is my first application built with React and Vite. This project serves as a learning experience to understand the fundamentals of React development.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite** - Next generation frontend tooling for fast development
- **JavaScript/JSX** - Programming language and React syntax extension
- **CSS** - Styling
- **ESLint** - Code linting and formatting

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dansbeer/first-react-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd first-react-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

### Development Mode
To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production
